However, existing\nmulti-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party\nagents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also\nface challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are\nlimited to single-device setups.\nFurthermore, these frameworks often rely on\nhard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task\nrequirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of\nAgents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a\nflexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA in-\ntroduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture de-\nsign, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control.\nThrough extensive experiments on general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and\nretrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effective\ncollaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linking\ndiverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlessly col-\nlaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities. Our codebase has been\nreleased at https:\/\/github.com\/OpenBMB\/IoA.\n1\nINTRODUCTION",
            "The Internet has revolutionized the way people collaborate and share knowledge, connecting indi-\nviduals with diverse skills and backgrounds from all around the world. This global network has\nenabled the creation of remarkable collaborative projects, such as Wikipedia1 and the development\nof the Linux operating system2, which would have been impossible for any single person to achieve.\nThe Internet has greatly facilitated collaboration among people, making the impossible possible and\npushing the boundaries of human achievement.\nThe success of the Internet in enabling human collaboration raises an intriguing question: can we\ncreate a similar platform to facilitate collaboration among autonomous agents? With the rapid ad-\nvancements in LLMs (OpenAI, 2023; Reid et al., 2024), we now have autonomous agents capable\nof achieving near-human performance on a wide range of tasks. These LLM-based agents have\ndemonstrated the ability to break down complex tasks into executable steps, leverage various tools,\nand learn from feedback and experience (Qin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Shinn et al., 2023;\n\u2217Equal Contribution.\nB Corresponding author.\n1https:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/\n2https:\/\/www.linux.org\/\n1\narXiv:2407.07061v2  [cs.CL]  10 Jul 2024",
